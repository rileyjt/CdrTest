# CdrTest
Manifesto


Open source code lacks ways to incentivize programmers to contribute to projects. The goal of Cdr is to directly incentivize code contributions via the distribution of an ERC-20 (CDR) token on the Ethereum network.

CDR is a governance token. Each Pull Request to the repository must be approved by CDR holders, and in turn will reward CDR from the daily issuance amount.

Dogfood everything - we will create a barebones process that works, then use the process to iterate and improve it via CDR contributions. This will give us insight into how to make the system better, and eventually allow us to add more diverse projects to the system.
